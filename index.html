  <h1>So I smoked weed for the first time yesterday, and had a terrible time. At first I didn't feel anything, then 5 minutes later the entire world seemed to stop and go in and out of being paused. It felt like I wasn't on earth anymore, but watching everything happen through bad reception television. I didn't see static or anything, but only fragments of what was actually happening entered my brain. I started to lose touch with reality and just sat there rushing in and out of what was real every 3 seconds, I kept stopping and being like wait! I remember what's going on! But by the time I finished that thought it would start again. That went on for like 20 minutes. Then the trip started to come down and I could somewhat tell what was going on, but everything was really really funny. After that my ability to perceive reality started to recover and I began to near the end of my trip. Then later everyone said that usually first timers have a weird trip and that my next time was would be not even close to the extremity of the first, especially in the same day. So whatever, I took two hits of the next joint and the same thing happened, only this time I really lost all touch with what was real. I remember periods of a few seconds in the car and that's about it really, I couldn't focus on anything for more than a second because in the next second it would be forgotten, or I wouldn't know where or when I was. I remember being at a playground and looking at the sand, and all the dents in the sand had shadows cast on them by the nearby light post and they turned into spectral mouths trying to eat me. Then I forget where I was again and I thought I was on the moon because of the sand, and I wanted donuts more than I've ever wanted anything in my life. I also felt extremely cold, and then this kid we were hanging out with brought me a sweatshirt. I don't remember much after that other than my friend driving me home, I honestly don't know how I made it into the house, or even my room, because at that point I barely knew my name. During the night I woke up a few times and thought I was still in the car imagining all of this and that only a few seconds had passed. This morning I feel like I can't concentrate on anything or remember anything for more than a few seconds. I know where I am, and I have all my past memories, I just feel like a zombie, like my brain has been switched to the lowest setting. I feel myself getting a little better, but it's going slow. I think that's the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me, I really felt like I was going to die, or that my brain would never recover and I'd have to spend the rest of my life in a mental asylum. It was like I was trapped a thousand miles away in my own head, watching life through that shitty tv connection I mentioned earlier. I still don't really know if this is real or not, I'm having a lot of trouble understanding anything right now. Did I smoke regular pot? Or what? My friends all smoked and were just fine 30 minutes later, but they smoke every single day, sometimes several times a day, and this was my first time. My friend deals, and apparently this was " Reeeaaalllly good shit " called " Blue Dream " if anyones heard of that before. It sure as hell doesn't feel like a dream, it feels more real than anything I've ever felt. Nothing tangible in this state of mind will ever feel as real as that felt. You know how sometimes you wake up at a friends house and think you're at your house and you're like " Wait fuck where am I? " I've been like that since I took my first hit. Little better though. Anyway, fuck weed I'm never smoking it again, lol.
